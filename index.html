<p><a href="http://holler.com.au">Holler, Sydney, Australia</a><br>March 2015 to July 2016 - 1 year, 5 months</p>
<p>Holler is a vibrant, dynamic and highly creative digital advertising agency
based in Sydney Australia. As technical lead, I was responsible for managing and
mentoring a team of 5 - 12 developers through a range of projects from one off
microsites to long term customer portal and integrated web applications using
multiple CMS systems, CRM data from Salesforce and Marketo, OpenAuth
systems, social APIs, Maps and other data sources.</p>
<p>I helped transition Holler and their clients through a number of major technical
changes. We moved legacy applications from ASP Webforms to javascript single
page applications with .NET backed micro-services serving JSON API&#39;s. We brought
in React.js as our primary front-end framework and implemented server side
rendering. Upgraded our front-end build processes and implemented continuous
integration with TeamCity and Octopus Deploy for all applications.</p>
