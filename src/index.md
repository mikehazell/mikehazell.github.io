## Professional Experience

### Technical Lead
[Holler, Sydney, Australia](http://holler.com.au)  
March 2015 to July 2016 - 1 year, 5 months

Holler is a vibrant, dynamic and highly creative digital advertising agency
based in Sydney Australia. As technical lead, I was responsible for managing and
mentoring a team of 5 - 12 developers through a range of projects from one off
microsites to long term customer portal and integrated web applications using
multiple CMS systems, CRM data from Salesforce and Marketo, OpenAuth
systems, social APIs, Maps and other data sources.

I helped transition Holler and their clients through a number of major technical
changes. We moved legacy applications from ASP Webforms to javascript single
page applications with .NET backed micro-services serving JSON API's. We brought
in React.js as our primary front-end framework and implemented server side
rendering. Upgraded our front-end build processes and implemented continuous
integration with TeamCity and Octopus Deploy for all applications.

### Senior front-end developer

As senior front-end with Holler I was responsible for architecting, building and

build tool-chain and mentoring other developers in the team. In this role I worked
with Audi, Heineken, Mirvac, Reckitt Benckiser, and Blackmores among other brands.

### Freelance Web Developer

 Front and Backend development and consultancy work. Working with the German
advertising agency Schaller & Partner GmbH for Bosch, AEG, Michelin and Junkers.
Most interesting for me was an iPad web app for Bosch built using ember.js for
the frontend and CodeIgniter for the backend. The project also involved local
storage and the ability to work offline.

internet presence for Heidelberger Druckmachinen Ag. including over thirty

websites.

### Customer Support Officer
Hewlett Packard Consumer PC  
[Datacom Systems Group, Sydney, Australia](http://datacom.com.au/)  
March - December 2004 and January to April 2006

Datacom provides high quality customer support services for major brands such as
Microsoft, Symantec, and Hewlett Packard. I worked as a Telephone customer

technical issues with their HP hardware and software.

This role taught me how to communicate with technical concepts with non-technical
people with patience and understanding while maintaining a friendly and
professional tone.
